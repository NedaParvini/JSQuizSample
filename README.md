Description:

First, I design a flow (algorithm) about the challenge to see it should be work.
Then I started to design index file
Define elements and classes 
Css file created and defined styles
Then I created a script file and started to write Javascript codes
I defined all of the variables
I needed to write JS codes for Scores, Time, High Scores and response after each question asked in the next page
when I click start button
First the time is 0 and when Start click it goes to the second part and start to work and pass, I set the timer for 100 seconds for 5 questions
If a question is wrong 10 seconds will be deducted from the total time
When it is done, the massage shows for the total scores based on correct answers
Also, high scores always accessible by clicking the link on top of the page
A function shows the questions and goes to another one automatically when an answer chosen
If the answer is correct shows correct in the next question if it is wrong shows the wrong and also shows the correct answer
If there is no more question the quiz is over or if the time is over before questions has not been answered
I needed to define my local storage and get the high score then I return it if there is anything left in it
Added event listener 
I tried to follow the instruction and the questions, color other elements look like the mockup as much as possible, so I divided all of the GIF frames to a different part to see what are the questions are
I also set @media to change the size based on a size of different devices in CSS styles
